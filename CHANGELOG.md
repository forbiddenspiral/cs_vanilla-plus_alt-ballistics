v0.1 - 05/04/2024

- Gameplay Adjustments:
  - Alternative Ballistics: Implemented core features replicating functionality from SRP v1.1.4. For detailed descriptions, refer to the "SRP v1.1.4 - Optional Features.txt" (link here: <https://github.com/Decane/SRP/blob/a4e5f513c87054973684da932b2664079157bdf1/SRP%20v1.1.4%20-%20Optional%20Features.txt>).
- Other Changes:
  - Enhanced NPC Vision: The NPC eye range has been increased from 80 to 100, aligning with Call of Pripyat. This allows NPCs to detect the player and other characters from a slightly longer distance.
  - AI Accuracy: Implemented 100% hit probability for AI, ensuring damage on any successful shot.
  - Improved Zombie Stealth: Tweaked zombie AI to enhance stealth gameplay. Players can now effectively hide behind vegetation from non-alerted zombies.
  - First Super Bullet Mechanic (Disabled): Removed the "super bullet" mechanic (matches COP) where the first aimed shot dealt significantly higher damage, particularly to the head. This ensures consistent weapon behavior based on base damage values.
